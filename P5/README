FAT12 Filesystem Reader

For this project I created two utilities in C:

msdosdir - Lists the root directory of a FAT12 disk image
msdosextr - Extracts all files in the root directory of a FAT12 disk image to
the local filesystem.

The FAT12 implementation itself can be found in fat12.{c/h}, these two utilities
make use of that implementation.

There is a Makefile that will build both utilities for convenience.

** Please note that currently the utilities are hardcoded to open the
samplefat.bin file in the same directory.  This can be easily changed if needed.
